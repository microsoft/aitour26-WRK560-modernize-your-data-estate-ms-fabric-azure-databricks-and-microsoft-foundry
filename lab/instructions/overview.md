# Lab Overview

This lab showcases Microsoft Fabric with Copilot and Microsoft Foundry, featuring a cost-effective, performance-optimized, and cloud-native Analytics solution pattern. This architecture unifies our customers' data estate to accelerate data value creation.

Zava is a retailer with thousands of brick-and-mortar stores across the world and an online store. Zava is acquiring Litware Inc., which has curated marketing data and sales data processed and stored in the gold layer in ADLS Gen2. Zava also has their customer churn data stored in the gold layer in ADLS Gen2.

In the following exercises, you will see how the Zava team leveraged the power of Microsoft Fabric to ingest data from a spectrum of sources, combine Litware's data with their existing data from ADLS Gen2, and derive meaningful insights.

The lab scenario begins on January 30th. The new CEO, Kayo, has noticed some negative trends in the company’s key metrics, including:

- A high number of their customers leaving

- Falling sales revenue

- High bounce rate on their website

- High operating costs

- Poor customer experience

And most importantly, low market sentiment

To address the high customer churn, Kayo and the Zava team decided to acquire Litware Inc., which carries products popular with millennials. Kayo asks Carlos, the Chief Technology Officer, how they could create a data-driven organization and reverse these adverse KPI trends. Carlos talks to his technical team, including Bryan, the data engineer; Reta, the data scientist; and Eric, the data analyst. He tasks them with designing and implementing a solution pattern to realize this vision of a data-driven organization.

During this lab you will execute some of these steps as a part of this team to reverse these adverse KPI trends. First, you will ingest data from a spectrum of data sources into OneLake for Zava. Let's get started!
